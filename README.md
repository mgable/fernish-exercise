    Pick an API from https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis

        Tip: APIs with No in the Auth column will allow you to make calls directly, and as such are recommended for use with this challenge.

    Using React (or your fav language,) create a simple single page app that demonstrates calling at least two API endpoints (e.g. a list and detail view from the same source).

        Show us your style! Part of any frontend development is an eye for design, so this is your chance to show us what you think looks good.

        Bonus points for including React Router, Redux, loading states, or additions that you feel improve the user experience.

    Publish your resulting project to Github as a Github Page and link it to us!
